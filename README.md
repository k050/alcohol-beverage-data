Started learning to code with intro programming MOOC

Due to steep learning curve did not start writing this code until 5/6.
This is something I will actually use.

It's not pretty, but it looks to be returning the data.
Trying out Github to save and work on different versions so I can try different
things but still revert back to something in the past if I don't like it.
May need some help at some point.

CA website had a bad link.  Added try-except(lic_number) right after tlst[] to skip these.  Added iso date just in case it's needed later.

    Don't update from CA website in the AM as they sometimes haven't.  
    Finished uploading pages and have multiple bad links.
    Not wanting to leave my laptop on all day, I need to move this to somewhere that's always on.

    Thinking about how to execute this automatically test each day.
    I decided to order a Pi and scheduling the program to run through linux(which I have no idea how to use).  This task may take a few days.  Also, created a log file on Pi to leave a record of the execution.

    Set-up the Pi.  Created a Crontab file to execute script everyday at 5PM.  If you do this again, don't forget to edit directory and file read, write, execute permissions for the database.  Otherwise program will throw an error when attempting to write to db.
